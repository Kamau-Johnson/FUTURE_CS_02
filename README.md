# Task 2: Password Analyzer Tool in Cyber Security
As part of my Cyber Security journey, I worked on Task 2: Password Analyzer Tool, a project designed to evaluate password strength and improve data security practices. This project aimed to help users assess and enhance their password security by providing instant feedback on password strength based on specific security criteria.

## Key Features of the Password Analyzer Tool:
✔ Strength Evaluation – Analyzes passwords based on length, character variety, and complexity.
✔ Real-time Feedback – Provides users with instant suggestions to strengthen their passwords.
✔ GUI-Based Interface – Developed using Tkinter for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
✔ Security Awareness – Educates users on best practices for creating strong passwords.

## Skills Developed:
🔹 Cyber Security Fundamentals – Understanding password vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
🔹 Python GUI Programming – Utilizing Tkinter to build an interactive interface.
🔹 Data Security Best Practices – Learning how to create strong and resilient password mechanisms.

## Learning Experience:
This project significantly enhanced my understanding of cyber security principles and secure coding practices. I gained hands-on experience in:

✔ Identifying weak passwords and providing actionable security improvements.
✔ Implementing logic-based password analysis for security evaluations.
✔ Creating an interactive and intuitive security tool using Python.

## Why This Project Matters for Future Interns:
Cyber Security is an increasingly critical field, and the ability to analyze and improve password strength is a foundational skill. This project offers Future Interns an opportunity to:

✅ Develop real-world security tools that address common security threats.
✅ Enhance problem-solving abilities in data protection and encryption.
